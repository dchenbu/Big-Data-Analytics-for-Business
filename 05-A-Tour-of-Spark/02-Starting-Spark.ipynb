It is because we haven't materialized the recipe for creating the DataFrame that we just created.\n\nCore data structures in Spark are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they\u2019re created.\n\nTo \u201cchange\u201d a DataFrame, you need to instruct Spark how you would like to modify it to do what you want. \n\nThese instructions are called **transformations**. Transformations are lazy operations, meaning that they won\u2019t do any computation or return any output until they are asked to by an action.\n\nLet\u2019s perform a simple transformation to find all even numbers in our current DataFrame:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"execution_count": 5, "cell_type": "code", "source": "divisBy2 = myRange.where(\"number % 2 = 0\")", "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"execution_count": 6, "cell_type": "code", "source": "divisBy2", "outputs": [{"execution_count": 6, "output_type": "execute_result", "data": {"text/plain": "DataFrame[number: bigint]"}, "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "The \"where\" statement specifies a narrow dependency, where only one partition contributes to at most one output partition. Transformations are the core of how you express your business logic using Spark. Spark will not act on transformations until we call an **action**.\n\n### Lazy Evaluation\n\nLazy evaulation means that Spark will wait until the very last moment to execute the graph of computation instructions. In Spark, instead of modifying the data immediately when you express some operation, you build up a plan of transformations that you would like to apply to your source data. By waiting until the last minute to execute the code, Spark compiles this plan from your raw DataFrame transformations to a streamlined physical plan that will run as efficiently as possible across the cluster. This provides immense benefits because Spark can optimize the entire data flow from end to end. An example of this is something called predicate pushdown on DataFrames. If we build a large Spark job but specify a filter at the end that only requires us to fetch one row from our source data, the most efficient way to execute this is to access the single record that we need. Spark will actually optimize this for us by pushing the filter down automatically.\n\n## Actions\n\nTransformations allow us to build up our logical transformation plan. To trigger the computation, we run an action. An action instructs Spark to compute a result from a series of transformations.
